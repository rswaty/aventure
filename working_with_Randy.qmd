## About me-professionally {.center}

I am an Ecologist with The Nature Conservancy's LANDFIRE team, where I do GIS analysis, science communications, and a fair amount of coding in R.

## I love to \[try to\] teach {.center}

## I am a high context communicator {.center}

<p style="text-align: center;">

This means that I will be totally confusing some of the time to some of you. You will need to ask for clarification from me, or (!) your classmates.

</p>

## Even though I code a lot {.center}

<p style="text-align: center;">

Still there is so much I don't know. You will need to lean on your own brainpower, Google, your peers and that elephant in the room.

</p>

<br>

*Also, I solve a lot of problems while walking, making things or doing dishes. While I really REALLY want to solve your problem RIGHT NOW, you may get a faster result on Slack :)*

## I am more of a coach than a prof {.center}

<p style="text-align: center;">

If you ever catch me showing you more than 10 slides, and/or if I have more than 30 words on a slide please YELL at me!

</p>

## And a few specifics

* Please, PLEASE, *please* try Google, AI and/or Slack and taking a walk before you e-mail me.

* Take our "performance conversations" seriously

* Give me feedback.  I am here to serve and want this to be valuable.
