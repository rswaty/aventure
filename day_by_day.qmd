## January, 2024

-   Randy days away: none

### January 16-introductions, admin and "how to work with Randy"

1.  Greetings (end at 8:40)! You are in a course called "Introduction to R and GitHub for Reproducible Research" taught by me, Randy Swaty.
2.  Extended introductions (9:00). I firmly believe we need to 'go slow to go fast', and that we need to know each other. I do not believe in throwing you to the coding wolves, at least not much. **Name, major, rose, bud, thorn**.
3.  About me, so you know what you are getting into (9:10).
4.  Go over syllabus. Talk computers, grading, ideal set up (second monitor, mouse, etc.)(9:20)
5.  Admin (9:45):
    -   set up GitHub accounts. Username-important. Go simple, include last name if possible. This could be a pain with 2-factor sign-in.
    -   fill out Google Form
    -   get everyone signed up for Slack

**I need to:**

-   [x] set up Google Form with:

    -   First and Last Name
    -   Rating of previous R experience
    -   Text box about previous R experience
    -   Goals for this class
    -   GitHub user name
    -   e-mail

-   test setting up github account with Finn or Kian or ??

-   [x] set up Slack channel

### January 18-install R and R-Studio, Happy Git With R

-   Greetings! Everyone OK? Do we have any new folks? Go over any Google Form results (end 8:45)

-   What is R, R-Studio and GitHub? (end 9:00)

-   Install R and R-Studio (9:15)

-   Happy Git With R (9:40). They have GitHub accounts already I hope!

-   Implore to finish Happy Git with R, post to Slack

**I need to:**

-   check Google Form results

### January 23-check git, set up r-studio, demo project and organization

1.  Greetings! How'd everyone do with the Happy Git with R? (end at 8:40)
2.  What is R? What is all that stuff I downloaded? Open R, do some math, write some comments, make a plot (8:50). Everyone!
3.  Tour and set up R-Studio. Go through the panes, and options (end at 9:00)
    -   do not open most recent r-studio project
    -   appearance
4.  Explain importance of organization and projects in R-Studio (9:15).
    -   when you open R/R-Studio it knows nothing.
    -   demo reading in a file that is not in the project directory and explain how this is a pain for you and others
5.  The better approach (9:30 ish)
    -   have everyone open and start a new repo then an r-studio project "r_examples"
    -   dir.create code, data, outputs
    -   create a beetle dataset, save as .csv.Â  ###COMMENT CODE!
    -   make a plot
    -   save plot

Why not save r when you close?

Stage, commit, push

### January 25-Check in, Quarto! Project set up review, first homework!

1.  Greetings-questions? (end at 8:40)
2.  Habit-open r-studio, recent projects, example_r, PULL (end 8:50)
3.  New Quarto file (end 9:00)
    -   3 components
    -   Visual and source. Go to source
    -   Render see HTML
4.  Headers (different than commenting code!), bold, italics, bullets, table of contents, running code (9:10)
5.  Some blogs for the curious

    -   https://rweekly.org/
    -   https://rladies.org/

**HOMEWORK** Take notes, report out on something cool
